# Tomas' Channel - Java Tutorials

The Tutorials I make are based off a JAVA paper I did at University

*** BEFORE YOU START BE SURE TO SUBSCRIBE - www.youtube.com/TomasChannel?sub_confirmation=1 ***

Welcome:
Oh so you want to learn java, well I guess you have come to the right place.

Introduction:
My name is Tomas and you're probably reading this because you're watching one of my tutorials. I am a Computer Science and Information and Technology Management Major. So I like to think you are in safe hands.

Tutorial Outcome -
  An introduction to object-oriented and concurrent programming. 
  You will learn fundamental skills in object-oriented software development, GUI programming and application-level multithreading.
  You will become confident and fluent with the Java language.

Breakdown of what you will learn:
  -paradigm, introducing objects,  methods, classes, interfaces, class hierarchies. 
  -Information hiding, abstraction, programming to interfaces, and enforcement of design features such as:
  ---Visibility qualifiers, constructors, constants, sealed classes, abstract classes and interfaces.
  -Data typing in object-oriented programming languages
  -The principle of substitution, method overriding and overloading, polymorphism, dynamic binding, generic types.
  -Framework GUI, framework (Java Swing), covers:
  -GUI framework (Java Swing), covers:
  ---Inversion of control principle. Application of fundamental OOP concepts, Event handling, Model/view design
  -Application-level programming consists of:
  ---lightweight threads programming model and thread lifecycle, Synchronisation, mutual exclusion, and liveness.
  ---Language dependent but to include abstractions:
  -----locks, executors, thread pools, and concurrent collections.
  ---Event dispatching thread, worker threads and background tasks, tasks with interim results.

Summary
By the end of my tutorials you will be proficient in the programming language "JAVA"

Tutorial Plan (Still being made) :

In this file I will refer to Youtube videos as :lessons.

Learning the Foundation of Java in 22 videos.
Lession 00 : Introduction To java & Setting up java
Lession 01 : Creating your first ever program
Lession 02 : Learning the basics of varables
Lession 03 : Learning how use System.out.print() to its full potential
Lession 04 : Learning How to take input from the keyboard or a file
Lession 05 : Learning how to make/use basic methods
Lession 06 : Learning how to use if loops
Lession 07 : Learning how to use the ? Operator loops
Lession 08 : Learning how to use switch statements
Lession 09 : Learning how to use for loops
Lession 10 : Learning how to use while
Lession 11 : Learning how to use do-while
Lession 12 : Learning how to use nest various loops 
Lession 13 : How to minipulate Strings
Lession 14 : 15 popular methods you NEED to know
Lession 15 : Learning how to do Method Overloading
Lession 16 : Learning what Primitive and Refrence types are
Lession 17 : Learning how to make and use Arrays
Lession 18 : Learning how to make and use Multidimensional Arrays 
Lession 19 : Learning how to make and use ArraysLists
Lession 20 : ArrayLists VS Arrays
Lession 21 : Learning how to make and use Wrapper Classes

Lession 22 : This lession is a test. 

Once complete lession 22 you will be able to download a certificate that you have finished my course (Good for a CV)

Once you have finished all of the lessions it is fair to say that you have a good foundation into all the basic aspects of java.
