The Tutorials I make are based off a JAVA paper I did at University

*** BEFORE YOU START BE SURE TO SUBSCRIBE - www.youtube.com/TomasChannel?sub_confirmation=1 ***

Welcome:
Oh so you want to learn java, well I guess you have come to the right place.

Introduction:
My name is Tomas and you're probably reading this because you're watching one of my tutorials. I am a Computer Science and Information and Technology Management Major. So I like to think you are in safe hands.

Tutorial Outcome -
  An introduction to object-oriented and concurrent programming. 
  You will learn fundamental skills in object-oriented software development, GUI programming and application-level multithreading.
  You will become confident and fluent with the Java language.

Breakdown of what you will learn:
  -paradigm, introducing objects,  methods, classes, interfaces, class hierarchies. 
  -Information hiding, abstraction, programming to interfaces, and enforcement of design features such as:
  ---Visibility qualifiers, constructors, constants, sealed classes, abstract classes and interfaces.
  -Data typing in object-oriented programming languages
  -The principle of substitution, method overriding and overloading, polymorphism, dynamic binding, generic types.
  -Framework GUI, framework (Java Swing), covers:
  -GUI framework (Java Swing), covers:
  ---Inversion of control principle. Application of fundamental OOP concepts, Event handling, Model/view design
  -Application-level programming consists of:
  ---lightweight threads programming model and thread lifecycle, Synchronisation, mutual exclusion, and liveness.
  ---Language dependent but to include abstractions:
  -----locks, executors, thread pools, and concurrent collections.
  ---Event dispatching thread, worker threads and background tasks, tasks with interim results.

Summary
By the end of my tutorials you will be profisent in the programming language "JAVA"
